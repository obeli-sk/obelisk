## Server configuration
api.listening_addr = "127.0.0.1:5005"   # Address and port on which the API server will listen.
webui.listening_addr = "127.0.0.1:8080" # Address and port on which the webui will listen.
# Note: listening on all interfaces using [::]:port is not advised, as there is no auth yet.

# sqlite.directory = "${DATA_DIR}/obelisk-sqlite" # Path to sqlite directory. Supports path prefixes.
# sqlite.pragma = { "cache_size" = "3000" } # Customize PRAGMA statements.

## WASM Cache dir
## Path to directory where downloaded or transformed WASM files are stored. Supports path prefixes.
## By default "${CACHE_DIR}/wasm" or "./cache/wasm" if no valid home directory path could be retrieved from the operating system.
# wasm.cache_directory = "${CACHE_DIR}/wasm"

# wasm.backtrace.persist = true        # Persist backtraces on effect calls for all workflows and webhook endpoints.
# wasm.allocator_config = "auto"       # One of "auto"|"on_demand"|"pooling"

## Global Preopened Directories Config
# [activities.directories]
# enabled = false                           # Disabled by default.
# parent_directory = "${TEMP_DIR}/obelisk"  # Make sure the folder is not on a RAM-backed filesystem if you plan to write large files.
# cleanup.enabled = true                    # Periodic cleanup job can be disabled, it is enabled by default.
# cleanup.run_every.minutes = 1             # Run the cleanup every minute by default.
# cleanup.older_than.minutes = 5            # Delete folders belonging to executions that finished 5 minutes earlier by default.

# [codegen_cache]
## Defaults:
# enabled = true
# directory = "${CACHE_DIR}/codegen" # Path to directory where generated code is cached. Supports path prefixes.

### WASM Component configuration
## Common settings for all components
# name = "name" # Each component must be named.
## Location can be a file path or an OCI registry reference.
# location.path = "path/to/wasm"
# location.oci = "docker.io/repo/image:tag"
# content_digest = "sha256:AA.." # Optional. If specified, the WASM file must have a matching hash.

## Common executor settings
# exec.batch_size = 5 # Number of executions to lock for every event loop tick.
# exec.lock_expiry.seconds = 1 # Each execution is locked for 1s by default.
# exec.tick_sleep.milliseconds = 200 # Sleep between event loop ticks.
# exec.max_inflight_instances = "unlimited" # If set to an integer, limits the number of inflight instances.

### WASM Activity components configuration
# [[activity_wasm]]
## Common settings for all components - see above.
## Common executor settings - see above.
## Specific settings for activity_wasm:
## Retry customization: All activities are retried on trap (panic) and timeouts until `max_retries` condition is met.
# max_retries = 5
# retry_exp_backoff.milliseconds = 100 # First retry is scheduled after 100ms after the failure, the next one after 200ms, then after 400ms...
# retry_on_err = true # When a function with a return type `result` returns the `Err` variant, attept to retry the execution.
## Guest std stream forwarding to host: one of "stdout","stderr","none". Default is "none".
# forward_stdout="stderr" # forwards stdout to host's stderr
# forward_stderr="stderr" # forwards stderr to host's stderr
## Environment variables: Set to a specific value or forward from the host. Default is empty.
# env_vars = ["ENV1", "ENV2=somevalue"]
## Preopened directory support
## When enabled, `.` will be available to the activity with all permissions.
## On host the folder is mapped to `activities.directories.parent_directory`/ExecutionID.
# directories.enabled = false # Disabled by default.
## If `reuse_on_retry` is enabled, the directory is not wiped clean on retries. Enable only if all disk IO is idempotent.
# directories.reuse_on_retry = false
## Activities that need process API must enable it explicitly. See `obelisk:activity/process@1.0.0` WIT interface.
## When running on linux, the `native` process API provider attempts to kill the spawned processes using process groups.
# directories.process_provider = "none" # Default is "none". Possible value: "none"|"native"

### Workflow components configuration
# [[workflow]]
## Common settings for all components - see above.
## Common executor settings - see above.

## Retry customization: All workflows are retried on trap (panic) and timeouts forever. Therefore, `retry_exp_backoff` must not be zero.
# retry_exp_backoff.milliseconds = 100 # First retry is scheduled after 100ms after the failure, the next one after 200ms, then after 400ms...

## Blocking strategy: When workflow requests a child execution result, it can either be interrupted, or kept in the memory until its execution lock expires or the response arrives.
## When "interrupt" is selected, after every child execution result the whole event history must be replayed.
# blocking_strategy = "await" # Default blocking strategy is "await"
# blocking_strategy = { kind = "await", non_blocking_event_batching = 100 } # Number of non-blocking events that can be cached and written in a batch.

# retry_on_trap = false # If set to true, traps(panics) will be handled as temporary failures and retried until the problem goes away.

# convert_core_module = true # Transparently convert Core WASM modules to WASM Components during startup.

# forward_unhandled_child_errors_in_completing_join_set_close = true # Forward unhandled child errors to the parent workflow when closing completing join sets.
## Map from frame symbol file names to corresponding file paths on local filesystem. Supports path path prefixes on both sides.
# backtrace.sources = {"frame symbol file path" = "path to the source file"}

# Stub WASI CLI world imports. Only needed for workflows authored in TinyGo.
# stub_wasi = false # Default is false.


### Webhook Endpoint section
# [[http_server]]
# name = "external"
# listening_addr = "0.0.0.0:9000"
# max_inflight_requests = "unlimited" # If set to an integer, limits the number of inflight requests
#
# [[webhook_endpoint]]
## Common settings for all components - see above.
# http_server = "external" # link to a `http_server`'s name

### Routes section
## An array of routes that will be matched against incoming requests.
## Only the path portion of a URL is taken into cosideration, the query part
## ("?param_name=value") is ignored by the matcher.
## Syntax of a route:
## "/"                                          # Only the root URL path is matched.
## "/path"                                      # All methods are matched, URL path must be exactly '/path'.
## "/path/*"                                    # All methods are matched, URL path must start with '/path/'.
## { methods = ["GET"], route = "/some/path" }  # Method must be GET and path '/some/path'.
## "/status/:param1/:param2"                    # When URL matches, `param1` and `param2` values will be exposed as env vars.
## ""                                           # Matches every possible URL, same as `/*`
## For details about the matching engine please see https://docs.rs/route-recognizer/latest/route_recognizer/
# routes = [{ methods = [ "GET" ], route = "/some"}, "/other"]

## Guest std stream forwarding to host: one of "stdout","stderr","none". Default is "none".
# forward_stdout="stderr" # forwards stdout to host's stderr
# forward_stderr="stderr" # forwards stderr to host's stderr

## Environment variables: Set to a specific value or forward from the host. Default is empty.
# env_vars = ["ENV1", "ENV2=somevalue"]

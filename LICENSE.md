# Project Licensing Information

This project (all files and folders except as noted below) is licensed
under the [GNU Affero General Public License version 3](LICENSE-AGPL).

## Subfolder Exceptions

The following subfolders are licensed under the MIT License:

## Generated WIT Files

The runtime includes functionality that may generate new "extension" WIT files. These generated files are typically based on a combination of user-provided WIT files and the base WIT definitions found in the MIT-licensed `wit/` directory.

**Clarification:** Any WIT files generated by this runtime **are NOT covered by the AGPL**. These generated files primarily derive from their inputs (user WIT files and the base MIT-licensed WIT files). To ensure clarity and maintain the intended separation between the runtime and user components, any WIT files generated by the runtime are provided under the terms of the **MIT License**, consistent with the base WIT files they often depend upon.

Users are free to use, modify, and distribute these generated WIT files under the terms of the MIT License, for example, to allow other WASM components to interact via these extended interfaces.
